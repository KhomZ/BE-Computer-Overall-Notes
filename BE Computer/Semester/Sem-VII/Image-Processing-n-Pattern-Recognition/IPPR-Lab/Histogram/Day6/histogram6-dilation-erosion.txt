Binary Morphological Basic Operations:
Erosion & Dilation are explained in-depth using wonderful Animation,
as well as explain Manual Implementation in Python.

This section mainly focuses on how to Erode/Dilate Binary Image for better object detection,
for better extraction or merging between two or more objects.



Morphological image processing is a collection of non-linear operations related to the shape or morphology of features in an image.


Dilation:
Dilation is the reverse process with regions growing out from their boundaries.
Dilation is A XOR B.

Erosion:
Erosion involves the removal of pixels at the edges of the region.
Erosion is just the dual of Dilation.

Both dilation and erosion are produced by the extraction of s set called a structuring element(SE)
