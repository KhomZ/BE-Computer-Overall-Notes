Salt-and-pepper: It is found only in grayscale images (black and white image). 
As the name suggests salt (white) in pepper (black)–white spots in the dark regions 
or pepper (black) in salt (white)–black spots in the white regions. 

In other words, an image having salt-and-pepper noise will have a few dark pixels in bright regions and 
a few bright pixels in dark regions. 

Salt-and-pepper noise is also called impulse noise. 
It can be caused by several reasons like dead pixels, analog-to-digital conversion error, bit transmission error, etc.

Let's see how to add salt-and-pepper noise in an image
> Salt and pepper noise can only be added in a grayscale image.
    So, convert an image to grayscale after reading it 
> Randomly pick the number of pixels to which noise is added (no_of_pixels) 
> Randomly pick some pixels in the image to which noise will be added.
    It can be done randomly picking x and y coordinate
> Note the random values generated must be within the range of the image dimensions.
    The x and y coordinates must be within the range of the image size.
> Random numbers can be generated using random number generator functions like random.randint used in the code
> Color some randomly picked pixels as black setting their value to 0
> Color some randomly picked pixels as white setting their value to 255
> Save the value of the image
