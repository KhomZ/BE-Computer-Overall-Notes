Convolution is a mathematical method of combining two signals to form a third signal.
The characteristics of a linear system is completely specified by the impulse response of the system
and the mathematics of Convolution.
It is well-known that the output of a linear time (or space) invariant system can be expressed
as a Convolution between the input signal and the system impusle response function.


Correlation
Correlation is a simple mathematical operation to compare two signals.
Correlation is also a Convolution operation between two signals.
Buth there is a basic difference. 
Correlation of two signals is the Convolution between with the functional inverse version of the other signal.

The resultant signal is called the cross-correlation of the two input signals.
The amplitude of cross-correlation signal is a measure of how much the received signal resembles the target signal.
The correlation peak specifies the location of the target.
