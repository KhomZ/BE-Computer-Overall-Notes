Artificial Intelligence
the theory and development of CS able to perform tasks


Applications of AI
1. Self driving cars
2. finance
-app called "DiGiT"
3. Games
4. Language translation
5. Publishing
-Echobox:
6. hospitals /medicine
7. email spam filtering 
facial recognition


how to get into ai
undergrad: won't see AI as a major
best major: CS

other majors
-math


Deepmind 
AI company owned by google
careers page
1. Research scientist
2. RFesearch scinetist
3. research engineer


other companies
computer science and eqv
computer science, electrical engg, robotics

robotics 
moving parts/hardware



AI 

mL
NLP
vision
speech
robotics



Machine Learning
s/w that can learn from past experiences (DATA)

computer get better over time>???
NO


Not machine learning 


If it used mL





it's easy for human to distinguish a cat and a dog
but a computer needs training



without mL
facial features....




program 

bunch of pictures of dog


output dog




at first program  is terrible 


learn how  to recognize one


Example


program that predicts your test score from

hours 

sleep





input : hours sleep
output : test score

hidden layer


neuron 
neural network


only weihted sums
wrong


activation function


1/(1+ e^-x)


where did the weights come from?
are they accurate>???


at the first weights are random (and wrong)

trainee


thousands of data


supervised learning 

unsupervised learninig

reinforcement 




facial recognition






Part2 


this is part 2 of AI

Machine learning 

super mario

make it to the end 

to begin computer was terrible

got to super human level




Chess
starting board

pawn a3    pawn a4 ............ nc3 (20 moves)\


					400 possible games
					over 100 million




Deep Blue 
chess playing computer developed by IBM
beat one of the greatest players 




alphaGo
that plays the game GO
dev by deepmind (owned by google)


more possibilities than chess


programmed to learn


beat 18 time world champion

no strategies / evaluation function


used neural networks



Deep Blue
Chess 
programmed evaluation function

AlphGo
no strategy 
lerant
ran millions of games
if it had an evaluation
function
-beat an avg player



Research / companies

--------------------------------------------------------------------

you can learn almost anything that anyone else can
can everyone do well????????
(learning, sports,......

we don't know??????


is it possible to walk into the worst high school, and teach them college level calculus???

stand and deliver
movie
-true story
-teaching at a school in east L>A. (worst ins the state)
-far behind academically
-serious social issues

they aren't capable of 



aren't borm equals


constant curiosity/learning

we all have interests we can turn into abilities 


ten thousand hour rule
it takes ten thousands and hours of deliberate




deliberate practice (serious study)


improvement 


6 years later 
significantly better 

practiced little more









if you just worked hard, you'll get better, but you will hit a performance plateau


deliberate practice is typically not enjoyable
-why most people don't



expert


failed to find evidence that says natural ability explains experts' success


mastering something 


Benjamin Bloom(educational psychology, mastery learning)

"What any person in the world can learn, almost all
persons can learn if provided with the appropriate 
prior and current conditions of learning"


how you put into the work
challenging yourself


engineers 
scientists
doctors
musicians
etc



struggling with class
final exam was one year from now

"Well okay yeah i'd study like crazy, but i woud have an
entire year to study(and a really strong incentive)"

have the ability to learn the topic

early in the term


better strategies
practiced harder
pushed through obstacles






study less study smart 
If you spend hours and hours of studying, without improving your grades,
or information retention, then learn how to study smart by Marty Lobdell.
Lobdell taught Psychology at Pierce College in Washington State for 40 years.
During Lobdells' career, he has taught cram for eight hours or more for a test
without any improvement, Lobdell has developed a studying technique that 
helps the brain retain the information that you are studying in this video 

"Study Less, Study Smart"
